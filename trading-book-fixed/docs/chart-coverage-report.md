Total laws mapped: 48
UNKNOWN_MAPPING count: 0

## Mapping modes
- ATTEMPT_C_CATEGORY_DERIVED: 24
- ATTEMPT_A_RECIPE: 8
- ATTEMPT_B_INDICATOR_FEATURE: 16

## Validation rule
- pass if lines>=2 AND boxes>=1 AND (labels+markers)>=1 AND lawSpecific>=1.

## Notes
- Category-derived mappings are conservative and deterministic and still require lawSpecific overlays.
